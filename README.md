Hey there! It's Michael, the software enthusiast with those "cool" engineering vibes. Why do I sound like I'm introducing myself at a party? Well, I'm jamming to the C language these days and super keen to jump into any zesty or game-changing projects. Drop me a line at michaelhilly99@gmail.com anytime. Why the encore intro, you ask? Well I dunno, GitHub's got its quirks! 😜 Keep those codes rockin' broh! 🎸👨‍💻🎈
